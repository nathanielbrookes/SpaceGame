## About The Game

I created this game using [Processing](https://processing.org/ "Processing") as part of my university coursework for the module: "Computer Animation and Multimedia".

This game is set in space, where the robot must collect elements from different planets and return to Earth before the end of the time limit. The player may encounter obstacles such as asteroids and black holes.


## Game Features

* The player can move the robot in any direction in space by holding the mouse down, and simulated physics has been implemented to model the interactions between the robot and the obstacles.

* 2D Perlin noise was used to procedurally generate the space nebula background.

* A parallax effect was achieved by animating backgrounds at different rates (stars, nebula and foreground).

* Animated rocket thrusters were made using a particle system.
